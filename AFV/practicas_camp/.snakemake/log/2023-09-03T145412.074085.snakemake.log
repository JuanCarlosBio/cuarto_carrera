MissingOutputException in rule microclima in file /home/juancarlos/Documentos/cuarto_carrera/AFV/practicas_camp/Snakefile, line 46:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/plots/microclima/12PAR_microclima
results/plots/microclima/13Temp_microclima
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
